# Portfolio

I built this portofolio website using Nuxt.js

# Under the hood 

- Nuxt.js has a built-in static website generator. My entire Nuxt.js app has been rendered as a static website.

- Website is deployed and hosting with [Netify](https://www.netlify.com/).

- As this is a serverless application, i'm using the [EmailJS](https://www.emailjs.com/) API to send email.
